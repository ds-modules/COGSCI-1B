This module explores a central question in cognitive science and linguistics: how do languages vary from one another? We explore existing datasets of linguistic features (e.g. WALS, Phoible) to come to tentative answers to this question in a data-driven way. Example problems include visualizing the distribution of phonemes, the relationship between geography and the development of languages, and the genetic relationships of languages.
